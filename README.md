# Flutter-Firebase Feature Templates

This is a Flutter-Firebase features template.
Aim is to build and learn the firebase features with flutter with proper architectures and good coding practices and have those in one place to reuse in other projects with ease.

I've started it with Folder-By-Feature-By-Type Architecture and for the State-Management I've choosen what the flutter provides already.

This can also be used by beginners who are starting with Flutter-Firebase as a learning point for building good coding practices while learning about firebase features.

## Getting Started
