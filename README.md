# Flutter-Firebase Feature Templates

This is a Flutter-Firebase features template.</br>
Aim is to build and learn the firebase features with flutter with proper architectures and good coding practices and have those in one place to reuse in other projects with ease.

I've started it with features based architecture and for the State-Management I've choosen the simple set-state which then can be easily extended with other SM if required.</br>

This can also be used by beginners who are starting with Flutter-Firebase as a learning point for building good coding practices while learning about firebase features.

To set up the firebase with your flutter project follow this steps
[FlutterFirebaseSetup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android)

Extra configurations may be needed for some features to work. You can learn how to set up those features through here</br>
[FlutterFireDocs](https://firebase.flutter.dev/)
